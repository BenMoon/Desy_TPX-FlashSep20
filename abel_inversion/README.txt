The abel inversion was done with the PyAbel software package
https://pyabel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

to gnereate the abel inverted image as well as the radial and energy distributions do:
python abel_inversion.py

the raw data might be located in a different folder, so this needs to be adjusted in abel_inversion.py
